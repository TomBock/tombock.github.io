        "description": "Originally funded with a Kickstarter Campaign, Dungeon Full Dive is a new, immersive way to play Tabletop RPGs (TTRPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons for VR and PC. I lead the team against the initial technical challenges of building a sandbox multiplayer game compatible with both platforms, namely Peer 2 Peer Multiplayer, Performance Optimization & Input complexity. Later, my focus shifted to the ruleset implementation of D&D and associated gameplay mechanics while managing a team of up to 5 Developers and 3 QA.",
