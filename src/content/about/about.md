**As part of [TxK Gaming Studios](https://txkgaming.com/)...**

As Managing director, I act as a **Producer**, that handles the Product planning, Financing and Developer Relations.

My Management role is similar to a **Scrum Master**, where I am planning and facilitating the development workflow
of the various departments, coordinating management tools and monitoring our progress in consideration of our goals.
My Job is to make everybody is up-to-date and able to perform at their best.

And in my role as **Game Developer**, I hold responsibility over the DevOps and Release processes, as well as the
actual implementation of various Gameplay features. Due to my experience in Web development, I often handle 
communication with Web Services and Data Management.

And this is only the tip of the iceberg, as is the nature of a small company, you will somehow do everything a little bit ðŸ˜‰
