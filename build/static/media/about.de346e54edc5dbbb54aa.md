**As part of [TxK Gaming Studios](https://txkgaming.com/)...**

As Managing director, I acted as a **Producer**, that handled the Product planning, Financing and Developer Relations.

My Management role was similar to a **Scrum Master**, where I planned and facilitated the development workflow. My Job was to make sure everybody is up-to-date and able to perform at their best.

And in my role as **Game Developer**, I faced various technological challenges, such as hardware limitations or network instability, and developed a multitude of solutions, ranging from gameplay to deployment.
My main involvements were: 
* Multiplayer Programming (Server- & Client-side coding)
* Performance Optimization
* D&D Ruleset Integration (Gameplay and stats)
* Test- & Release Automation (CI / CD)
* Unity Engine Tool Development

I am very glad for my time at TxK and the possibility to learn new skills and hone others. But similarly, I realized there is a lot more that I want to about Game Development and I look forward to every opportunity to do so. :D
